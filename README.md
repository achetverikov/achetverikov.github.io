Hi! I'm a cognitive (neuro)scientist studying probabilistic brains and developing new methods for neuroimaging and cognitive studies at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behavior. Here are my Github projects:

- [circhelp](https://achetverikov.github.io/circhelp) - a small helper package in R for circular data analyses
- [APAstats](https://github.com/achetverikov/APAstats) - R package for formatting results in APA style in LaTeX & RMarkdown
- [Visual Search DB](https://github.com/achetverikov/visual_search_db) - a living and growing database of visual search datasets
- [Power analysis via simulations in R](https://github.com/achetverikov/power_simulations_in_R) - a short tutorial

There's more in [my Github profile](https://github.com/achetverikov). And if you want to know more about my research, check out [my website](https://andreychetverikov.org).
