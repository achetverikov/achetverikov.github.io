Hi! I'm a cognitive scientist studying probabilistic mind and developing computational models for cognitive studies at the University of Bergen (Norway). Here are my GitHub projects:

- [PRESTUS](https://github.com/achetverikov/PRESTUS) - a set of functions for ultrasonic simulations including brain preprocessing, extracting data from Localite neuronavigation files, and more
- [circhelp](https://achetverikov.github.io/circhelp) - a small helper package in R for circular data analyses
- [APAstats](https://github.com/achetverikov/APAstats) - R package for formatting results in APA style in LaTeX & RMarkdown
- [Visual Search DB](https://github.com/achetverikov/visual_search_db) - a living and growing database of visual search datasets
- [Power analysis via simulations in R](https://github.com/achetverikov/power_simulations_in_R) - a short tutorial

There's more in [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/achetverikov). And if you want to know more about my research, check out [my website](https://andreychetverikov.org).
